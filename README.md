## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to apply all the concepts learned in the course in chapters Instance Based Learning, Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning on a real-world dataset. You'll work on this assignment in several steps. Submission of the various parts is planned over the course of the entire semester. See Canvas for more details.

## Project Setup
A folder containing the dataset and the notebooks (see below). Use a virtual environment to install the dependencies for this assignment. Create a `requirements.txt` file and add the dependencies to it, so the instructor can install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Assignment
This assignment is divided into many parts. As we learn more concepts in the course, you will be required to apply them to your dataset.

The most important part of the assignment is the progress that you make. You should be able to show the improvements that you have made to the performance of the models, so it's essential to record that progress.

Use multiple Jupyter Notebooks to write the code and the report intertwined. Every notebook should show the improvements over the previous notebook. For example, the first notebook shows any preprocessing, feature selection, feature engineering, ... you did and explains why. The second notebook should show the performance of the models after preprocessing, feature selection, feature engineering, etc. The third notebook should show the performance of the models after hyperparameter tuning, ensemble learning, etc.

The report should be well written and well organized. You should also be able to show the improvements that you have made to the code. The code should be clean, readable, and well-documented. You should also be able to show the improvements that you have made over the course of the assignment.

### Part 1 - Dataset & Data Preprocessing
#### Dataset Selection
Each student chooses a dataset of their choice. There are, however, some requirements that the dataset must meet:

- The dataset is suited for a classification or a regression problem and must have at least 1000 instances and 10 features (dimensions).
- The dataset should accommodate the use of all the machine learning algorithms learned in the course.

So, before you pick a dataset, make sure it meets the above requirements and check with the instructor if in doubt. The better the dataset, the better the results you will get, and the easier it will be to apply all the concepts learned in the course. Be prepared to alter the dataset if it does not meet the requirements. Write code so that altering the dataset is easy.

The reference section contains a list of datasets that you can select from. Other datasets can be found on the internet.

#### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a very important part of machine learning. It is the process of preparing the data for machine learning. The following steps are part of the data preprocessing process:

- Data Preparation: make sure the dataset is ready for machine learning algorithms. Clean the data, remove outliers, handle missing values, etc. You have seen these techniques in earlier courses.
- Feature Engineering: create new features from the existing features. Sometimes it's better to create new features than to use the existing features. Also think about how to encode categorical features, normalize features, etc.
- Feature Selection: remove features that are not useful to improve the performance of the models

### Part 2 - Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
Build machine learning models for the dataset. You can choose your own target variable and the features that you want. Depending on your target variable, you'll be dealing with a classification or a regression problem. You can use any machine learning algorithm that you want, but try out multiple models. You can use any metric that you want to evaluate the performance of the models. You can also use multiple metrics. You can use any hyperparameter tuning technique that you want. You can also use multiple techniques. The goal is to get the best performance possible. The following concepts are part of this part of the assignment:

- Model Evaluation: evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms, use appropriate metrics, and validation techniques.
- Model Selection: explore the best models for your dataset. Compare the models using cross-validation. Record your progress.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: tune the hyperparameters of the models using search methods.

## Submission
See Canvas for the submission dates (plural). The assignment is to be submitted as a zipped folder containing your dataset, one or more Jupyter Notebooks, a Python virtual environment `requirements.txt` file.

## Evaluation
During the first period of the course, you will be evaluated at specific points in time (see Canvas). These evaluations are low-stake evaluations. They are also used to give you feedback on your progress. You will still be able to improve your grade by improving your progress.

At the end of the first and second period of the semester, you will be evaluated again. These evaluations are high-stake evaluations. This final evaluation is used to determine your final grade. This means that you can still improve your grade by showing new progress right up to and including the evaluation at the end of the second period.
